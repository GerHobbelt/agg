    <p>A single pixel on a color LCD is made of three colored elements</br>
    ordered (on various displays) either as blue, green, and red (BGR),</br>
    or as red, green, and blue (RGB). These pixel components, sometimes</br>
    called sub-pixels, appear as a single color to the human eye because</br>
    of blurring by the optics and spatial integration by nerve cells in the eye.
    </p>
 
    <p class="italic">The components are easily visible, however, when viewed with</br>
    a small magnifying glass, such as a loupe. Over a certain resolution</br>
    range the colors in the sub-pixels are not visible, but the relative</br>
    intensity of the components shifts the apparent position or orientation</br>
    of a line. Methods that take this interaction between the display</br>
    technology and the human visual system into account are called</br>
    subpixel rendering algorithms.
    </p>

    <p>
    The resolution at which colored sub-pixels go unnoticed differs,</br>
    however, with each user some users are distracted by the colored</br>
    "fringes" resulting from sub-pixel rendering. Subpixel rendering</br>
    is better suited to some display technologies than others. The</br>
    technology is well-suited to LCDs, but less so for CRTs. In a CRT</br>
    the light from the pixel components often spread across pixels,</br>
    and the outputs of adjacent pixels are not perfectly independent.
    </p>

    <p class="italic">
    If a designer knew precisely a great deal about the display's</br>
    electron beams and aperture grille, subpixel rendering might</br>
    have some advantage. But the properties of the CRT components,</br>
    coupled with the alignment variations that are part of the</br>
    production process, make subpixel rendering less effective for</br>
    these displays. The technique should have good application to</br>
    organic light emitting diodes and other display technologies.
